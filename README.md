# Jetson-Orbbec Volumetric Video Capture for Ithaca Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** with **Orbbec Femto Mega** cameras for synchronized, efficient volumetric video capture. Designed for scalable systems such as the *Ithaca* 9-camera setup, this solution minimizes frame drops, reduces bandwidth strain, and simplifies wiring using edge processing.

## üìå Motivation

Traditional multi-camera, multi-PC systems struggle with:
- üö´ **Frame drops due to USB or network congestion**
- üîå **Tangled wiring and difficult synchronization**
- üñ•Ô∏è **Expensive and power-hungry host PCs**

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Jetson Nano + Orbbec

- **Edge computing**: Record directly on Jetson Nano to avoid network delays.
- **Simplified wiring**: USB 3.0 from camera to Nano; no need for long Ethernet or sync chains.
- **Affordable scaling**: Each Nano is low-cost and energy-efficient.
- **Portable and compact**: Fits in tight studio setups.
