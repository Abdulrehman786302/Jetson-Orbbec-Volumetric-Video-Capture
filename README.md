# Jetson-Orbbec/Kinect Volumetric Video Capture for Ithaca Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** with **Orbbec Femto Mega/Bolt** and **Microsoft Kinects** cameras for synchronized, efficient volumetric video capture. Designed for scalable systems such as the *Ithaca* 9-camera setup, this solution minimizes frame drops, reduces bandwidth strain, and simplifies wiring using edge processing.

## üìå Motivation

Traditional multi-camera, multi-PC systems struggle with:
- üö´ **Frame drops due to USB or network congestion**
- üîå **Tangled wiring and difficult synchronization**
- üñ•Ô∏è **Expensive and power-hungry host PCs**

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Jetson Nano + Orbbec/Kinect

- **Edge computing**: Record directly on Jetson Nano to avoid network delays.
- **Simplified wiring**: USB 3.0 from camera to Nano; no need for long Ethernet or sync chains.
- **Affordable scaling**: Each Nano is low-cost and energy-efficient.
- **Portable and compact**: Fits in tight studio setups.

## Jetson Nano Setup with Rufus + JetPack

This guide outlines the steps to set up a **Jetson Nano** (4GB/2GB) using **Rufus** to flash the SD card with a pre-built **JetPack** image. It includes instructions for both the **microSD** and **eMMC** versions of the Jetson Nano.

## ‚úÖ What You Need

- **Jetson Nano Developer Kit** (4GB or 2GB version)
- **microSD card** (minimum 32GB, UHS-1 recommended)
- **microSD card reader** for your Windows PC
- **Rufus tool**: [Download here](https://rufus.ie/)
- **JetPack SD card image** for Jetson Nano:  

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Download JetPack Image

1. Go to [JetPack SDK Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-sd-card-image) 
2. Extract the `.img` file using the built-in unzip feature or a tool like 7-Zip.

### Step 2: Flash SD Card with Rufus

1. Insert the microSD card into your card reader.
2. Open **Rufus**.
3. In Rufus:
   - **Device**: Select your microSD card.
   - **Boot selection**: Click *SELECT* and choose the `.img` file you extracted.
   - **Partition scheme**: Set to `MBR`.
   - **File system**: Leave it as the default.
4. Click **START** to begin flashing. Confirm any prompts.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This process will erase all data on the microSD card.

### Step 3: Boot the Jetson Nano

1. Insert the flashed microSD card into the Jetson Nano.
2. Connect your display (HDMI/DisplayPort), USB keyboard & mouse, and power supply.
3. Power on the Jetson Nano.
4. The first boot may take several minutes. You'll be prompted to complete the Ubuntu setup process (select language, timezone, username, etc.).

## ‚ö° Optional: First Boot Tweaks

- **Network**: Connect to Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
- **Update system**: Run the following commands to ensure everything is up-to-date:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update 

## üîß Jetson Nano Setup with Orbbec SDK

To set up your Jetson Nano with Orbbec K4A SDK support: first set your password of jetson inside file.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the setup script:

# Custom Parameters
You can now set additional camera parameters during recording via the modified k4arecorder binary:

--brightness <value>

--contrast <value>

--sharpness <value>

Additional arguments can be added into the ` ./k4arecorder`  by updating ` tools/k4arecorder`  folder before ` build/bin/`  supports these parameters.

You must update and build the SDK using your modified `tools/k4arecorder` folder.

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./setup_orbbec_jetson.sh
 ./setup_orbbec.sh
```

## üîß Azure Kinect SDK Setup (Jetson)

To build the Azure Kinect Sensor SDK on Jetson:

1. Update the `USER_NAME` and `DOWNLOAD_DIR` variables in the script.
2. Run:

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./install_kinect_sdk.sh
 ./install_kinect_sdk.sh
```


## üîß Dummy Display Setup for Headless Jetson

### üìã Overview

This script sets up a **dummy display** on Jetson devices in **headless mode**. It is particularly useful when you're running a Jetson without a physical monitor but need to configure X11 (e.g., for remote desktop solutions or GPU-related tasks).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Installs `xserver-xorg-video-dummy`** if not already installed.
- **Clears and writes** the `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` file with a dummy display configuration.
- **Handles sudo with a predefined password** (replace with your own for security).
- Optional: You can choose whether to enable the dummy display during setup.

### üîß Installation & Usage

To use the script, follow these steps: first set your password of jetson inside file.

1. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x ./setup_dummy_display.sh
   sudo ./setup_dummy_display.sh
    ```

## üåê Jetson Display to Master Machine Using NoMachine
